# file-compression-v1
my os project on file compression. will be developed until perfected.
THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN THE THE CODE, SAMPLE USED AND RELEVENT OUPUTS OF THE FILE COMPRESSOR.
FUTURE GOALS:
1. COME UP WITH A BETTER COMPRESSION METHOD (HAD TO RUSH DUE TO DEADLINE)
2. APPEND A DECOMPRESSOR
3. CREATE A UI
4. POSSIBLY MAKE IT A STANDALONE APPLICATION (USING TERMINAL EACH TIME IS NOT USER-FRIENDLY)
